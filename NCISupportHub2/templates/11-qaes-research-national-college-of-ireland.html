        <p>
         As part of the National College of Ireland’s (NCI) Institutional Strategy, it has committed to ‘developing an active research and enterprise culture which supports the growth and development of Ireland’s knowledge economy’ (Key Goal 5).  In order to achieve this goal the College is fully committed to becoming a research active institution.  The College is aware of national objectives for research and wishes to play a full part in helping to achieve these while recognising the important role that research has to play in informing the teaching and learning strategy of the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         As a small institution with maturing research development, NCI has a number of strengths both in terms of its flexibility due to its relatively small number of staff and its ability to create true multi-disciplinary teams to address issues of academic and national interest.  Having stated this there are clear limitations inherent in our relative small size and limited research experience which require us to critically examine possible routes to expanding and extending our research capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         It has long been recognised that it is neither desirable nor possible to have one single institute of higher education which excels in providing first class research across all disciplines.  Indeed policy initiatives and funding around research has emphasised the need for Irish institutions to work in a multi-disciplinary collaborative manner in order to achieve economies of scale.  The National College of Ireland, in developing its research strategy, is cognisant of this reality and while we have ambitious plans we recognise that these must be built upon sound foundations through working closely with both national and international partners.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The College is in a strong position to play an important research role in niche areas in which it has the expertise, experience and connectivity that can be leveraged to contribute to the challenges of the knowledge economy in Ireland.  Research enhances the College’s institutional standing, reputation and recognition as a third level educational institution.  It also provides an opportunity to maximise funding and develop a broader set of relationships, including collaborative partnerships with other educational institutions, industry and other organisations.  An active research environment not only enriches the College’s scholarly endeavours but is also critical to underpinning the development of a thoughtful and robust Teaching &amp; Learning Strategy which is in addition closely aligned to the Knowledge Transfer aspirations of the College.  The College aims to ensure that there is a clear link between what we teach and what we research and that the new knowledge created is accessible to all interested stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Research at National College of Ireland is regarded as a core activity which is embedded in the academic culture and which contributes to the overall mission of the College.  The vision for research at the National College of Ireland is one which sees it as contributing to the realisation of Ireland’s full potential as a knowledge-based economy. The delivery on this vision is through the development of a number of research active clusters.  In doing so the Research Strategy is directly linked to and informs the Teaching and Learning and the Knowledge Transfer Strategies.  The College is also committed to ensuring that learners from a diversity of backgrounds have access to education, at all levels including postgraduate research opportunities.  The new Institutional Strategy continues this commitment.

         11.1.1   Process of Research Strategy Formulation
        </h3>
        <p>
         The institutional Research Strategy is developed by the Research Committee. A Research Committee was convened in 2007 with the purpose of reviewing the Institutional Strategy and identifying potential strategic opportunities for the development of an integrated strategic College wide Research Strategy.  The Research Committee is comprised of representatives from each of the Schools, administrative staff, enterprise staff and is chaired by the VP Academic Affairs Research or nominee.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Research Strategy is informed by the institutional strategy and by developments in the broader national and international education, research and knowledge transfer strategy space.

         Supervisory Process
        </h3>
        <p>
         Supervision of postgraduate research students is set out in the Maynooth University manual and is designed to ensure that postgraduate research students receive adequate direction to learn advanced research methods and to facilitate the successful completion of their degree. Supervisors may only supervise a maximum of four research students at any one time.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Primary Supervisor will be primarily responsible for regular supervision. The supervisory committee will comprise up to two Secondary Supervisors and shall be agreed by Academic Council. The replacement or substitution of a supervisor on any grounds requires the prior approval of Academic Council, or its nominee, usually the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are a number of issues that may arise in the programme of a research study that require expert guidance from the supervisor. The Primary Supervisor and student should at all times maintain a good working relationship.  The relationship requires that the Primary Supervisor:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Establish and maintain a relationship of trust in which the responsibilities and expectations of both the Primary Supervisor and the student are clearly outlined and discussed at the outset of the research
         </li>
         <li>
          Implement best practice in the supervisory practice, including the use of the supervisory committee
         </li>
         <li>
          Provide monitoring, assessment and written feedback on a regular basis to the student
         </li>
         <li>
          Ensure that progress reports are completed with the student and returned at the end of each semester to the Research Office
         </li>
         <li>
          Make an annual report on the progress of each student to the Research Office, detailing satisfaction with progress to date, the research plan for the forthcoming year, as agreed by the research student and the supervisor
         </li>
         <li>
          Identify with the student their training needs and supporting the provision of educational and training programmes
         </li>
         <li>
          Help students with networking and providing advice on professional academic development, including encouraging students to attend academic conferences and training workshops
         </li>
         <li>
          Brief students on academic rules and regulations
         </li>
         <li>

          Whenever possible prior to enrolment, discuss with the student the nature of the research and the standards appropriate for the degree and negotiate an agreed research topic. A topic Maynooth Universityst be chosen which enables research embodying new knowledge at a level appropriate to the degree to be completed in the specified time. The experience of the supervisor is an essential element in choosing the topic and it is the supervisor’s responsibility to seek to ensure that the topic is appropriate.
         </li>
         <li>
          Give guidance about the nature of research and the standard expected, about the planning of the research programme and presentation of a research proposal, about literature research and appropriate courses to attend.
         </li>
         <li>
          Assist the student with planning. The supervisor should ensure that accurate information regarding his/her own research and professional/administrative leave, any retirement plans and contract duration throughout period of the student’s project is given to the student
         </li>
         <li>
          Maintain contact through regular supervisory meetings with the student; request regular written work or results of research to date. Return such reports in reasonable time with comments as necessary.
         </li>
         <li>
          Seek to ensure progress of the student is evaluated annually as outlined in the departmental handbook.
         </li>
         <li>
          Seek to ensure that the work reported in the dissertation is the student's own.
         </li>
         <li>
          If the supervisor feels obliged to recommend a student’s studies be discontinued because of unsatisfactory progress, he/she Maynooth Universityst make this recommendation to the Head of Department/Departmental Supervisory Committee who will inform the student accordingly.
         </li>
         <li>

        </h3>
        <p>
         All researchers in NCI must be committed to the  highest standards of professional conduct. Researchers have a duty to ensure that their work enhances the good name of the College and the profession to which they belong.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Researchers should participate only in work which conforms to accepted ethical standards and which they are competent to perform. All academic debates or disputes relating to research and publications should be carried out in a respectful manner so that there will be no harm to the reputation of individuals or of the College
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The College has a responsibility to ensure the health and safety of all those associated with research initiatives. Any breaches of regulations by students will be dealt with by the Disciplinary Process. Breashes by staff members will be dealt with by the Staff Disciplinary process.

         11.1.22                Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
         As part of the National College of Ireland’s Institutional Strategy, it has committed to ‘developing an active research and enterprise culture which supports the growth and development of Ireland’s knowledge economy’. The College is aware of national objectives for research and wishes to play a full part in helping to achieve these while recognising the important role that research has to play in informing the teaching and learning strategy of the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Appendix 11 describes a summary of the IP principles as approved by the NCI executive board in conjunction with solicitors at Gallen Alliance.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a small institution at the early stages of research development, NCI has a number of strengths both in terms of its flexibility due to its relatively small number of staff and its ability to create true multi-disciplinary teams to address issues of academic and national interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Research at National College of Ireland is regarded as a core activity which is embedded in the academic culture and which contributes to the overall mission of the College. The vision for research at the National College of Ireland is one which sees it as contributing to the realisation of Ireland’s full potential as a knowledge-based economy. The delivery on this vision is through the development of a number of research active clusters. In doing so the Research Strategy is directly linked to and informs the Teaching and Learning and the Knowledge Transfer Strategies. The College is also committed to ensuring that learners from a diversity of backgrounds have access to education, at all levels including postgraduate research opportunities. The new Institutional Strategy reflects this commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
         This document contains the updated policy and procedures relating to NCI’s intellectual property. In accordance with accepted International Best Practice, it sets out the policy and rules that govern the creation, ownership and commercialisation of intellectual property developed by NCI staff, students and others participating in educational programmes carried out for NCI or undertaken using NCI facilities, know-how, confidential information or intellectual property. This policy does not apply to companies that use NCI facilities on a commercial basis for example a company that uses the usability lab using Enterprise Ireland innovation vouchers is exempt from this policy.  The Policy is intended to actively support the commercialisation of Intellectual Property in a manner which ensures maximum benefit to society and the Irish economy, while providing significant financial reward and recognition for the creator of the intellectual property, NCI and where appropriate, the sponsor of the research.
        </p>
        <p>
         NCI encourages the commercialisation of Intellectual Property through a support programme and a share of the resulting income to the creators of such intellectual property.
        </p>
        <p>
         This document builds on the National College of Irelands Research and Knowledge Transfer Strategy and the Intellectual Policy as described in the National College of Irelands Research Strategy, 2007-2014. In addition this document strives to take account of the changes in legislation including the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 and related policies such as National Codes of Practice and the Funding Agency guidelines for management and commercialisation of intellectual property (Annex VI) as follows:

         11.1.25                Definition and Ownership
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Irish statutory provisions governing the ownership of intellectual property rights are described in Appendix 1.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a general rule (and subject to the exceptions set out in the Policy) the rights to NCI Intellectual Property is the property of and vests solely and absolutely in NCI. NCI Intellectual Property includes any intellectual property in any materials and/or inventions created by academic, research and other NCI staff (full-time or part-time) in the course of their employment or by students in the course of their education by NCI or by consultants or others in the course of research, development, teaching, consultancy and other intellectual activity carried out for NCI. These personnel are collectively referred to as NCI personnel in this document. NCI Intellectual Property includes rights in any material, including any copyright (including rights in computer software and moral rights but subject to the exception set out below), patent, design right, trademark rights, brand rights, database rights, know how, trade secrets, confidential information, rights in design, or other intellectual property rights or other property rights, whether vested, contingent or future anywhere in the world. (A full definition of intellectual property is contained in Appendix 2). The Policy applies particularly but not exclusively to any intellectual property rights in materials and/or inventions which are created in whole or in part or caused to come into existence by NIC personnel:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          While undertaking normal or specifically assigned duties either when intellectual property could be reasonably expected to result from the carrying out of those duties and/or, at the time the intellectual property was developed, there was a special obligation on the creator of the intellectual property to further NCI’s interest;
         </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
         <li>
          When using NCI’s equipment, supplies, facilities or NCI’s Assets.
         </li>
         <li>
          Using NCI’s confidential information, trade secrets, know how or any of the intellectual property of NCI; or
         </li>
         <li>
          In relation to any work performed for NCI (including pursuant to any third party funded research programmes).
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Under the terms of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 NCI owns all copyright in works created by its employees in the course of their employment. In recognition of the unique position of NCI and in accordance with long-standing academic tradition, NCI does not and will not assert ownership of copyright in pedagogical works, scholarly publications, books or artistic works of its employees, regardless of the form of expression, unless there is a written agreement to the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
         This exception to NCI ownership of intellectual property does not extend to copyright in software or to database rights. NCI will not assign rights to the usage of teaching materials to any third party without the prior agreement of the author/creator. If there is an opportunity to exploit those materials/works with a party independent of NCI, then the commercial value of that exploitation will be shared between NCI and the author/creator in accordance with the policy on shared royalties.

         11.1.28                General Provisions of NCI IP Policy
        </h3>
        <p>
         As a general rule subject to the exceptions set out in this IP Policy, any IP rights in or to any material/works created by Personnel in the course of their employment or education by NCI or in relation to work carried out for NCI is the property of and vests solely and absolutely in NCI or such companies or organisations as NCI may nominate for such purposes. Such material/works include, but are not limited to any:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Copyright (including rights in computer software and moral rights);
         </li>
         <li>
          Patents;
         </li>
         <li>
          Design rights;
         </li>
         <li>
          Trademark rights;
         </li>
         <li>
          Brand rights;
         </li>
         <li>
          Database rights;
         </li>
         <li>
          Know how;
         </li>
         <li>
          Trade secrets;
         </li>
         <li>
          Confidential information rights in design;
         </li>
         <li>
          Or other intellectual property rights or other property rights, (whether vested, contingent or future anywhere in the world).
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         This applies to any IP developed by personnel which they cause to come into existence:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          During their time in NCI or if related to the College personnel’s job responsibilities, even if he or she is not specifically requested to create it;
         </li>
         <li>
          When using NCI’s equipment, supplies, facilities or NCI Assets;
         </li>
         <li>
          During an individual’s use of their personal time or own facilities if the basic nature of the work created is related to the individual’s job;
         </li>
         <li>
          Using NCI’s confidential information, trade secrets, know how or any NCI IP; or
         </li>
         <li>
          In relation to any work performed for NCI (including pursuant to any third party funded research programmes).
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         At NCI's reasonable cost, Personnel also agree at any later time to execute any documentation or otherwise provide assistance to NCI to secure, protect, perfect or enforce any of NCI’s rights, title and interests in and to NCI IP.
        </p>
        <p>
         This IP Policy is applicable to IP that is owned by NCI, for (without limitation) any of the reasons outlined below:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          It is developed by personnel in the course of their normal or specifically assigned duties either when IP could reasonably be expected to result from the carrying out of those duties and/or, at the time the IP was developed, there was a special obligation on the relevant personnel to further the interest of NCI.
         </li>
         <li>
          Under the 2000 Act (as defined in Appendix 1 of this IP Policy), NCI is the first owner of any copyright in the work created by staff in the course of their employment unless precluded by a prior agreement between NCI and a third party (or as covered by section 11.1.28 of this IP Policy).
         </li>
         <li>
          The IP arises out of funded or non-funded research where such research has, in the opinion of NCI, made use of the equipment, facilities, NCI Assets and/or other resources of NCI (except where ownership of such IP was provided for in a prior agreement between NCI and third parties).
         </li>
         <li>
          If it is a condition of the appointment of a student to perform research, that NCI should have ownership of the IP arising from the research performed by such student.
         </li>
         <li>
          If it is a condition of the appointment of another Relevant Party to perform research that NCI should have ownership of the IP arising from the research performed by such Other Relevant Party.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         IP arising from research or other work sponsored by an external organisation shall be subject to the IP provisions that are stipulated in the related agreement between NCI and the external organisation. Where such an  agreement requires all new IP rights to be assigned to a private company, the entry level (or “background”) NCI IP should be defined so that it is not inadvertently assigned to the private company as part of the new IP (also described as “foreground IP” or “results”) but is retained as NCI IP. All such research agreements should be reviewed by a legal person representing NCI.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the avoidance of doubt, where IP is generated from research that is 100% funded by monies provided directly by the State, or by any not-for-profit financial instrument which has been established by an organisation or individual, and awarded through a public service organisation charged with the granting and dissemination of research funds, this IP will be exclusively and absolutely owned by NCI and subject to the terms of the granting body.
        </p>
        <p>
         The IP Policy also extends to Other Relevant Parties such as non-employees who participate in research projects at the college including visiting academics, industrial personnel etc. unless a specific waiver has been approved. Other Relevant Parties at NCI who have a prior existing and conflicting intellectual property agreement or arrangement with another employer or third party must enter into an agreement with NCI (and their employer or relevant third party) (see Appendix 10) to abide by the conditions of this IP Policy in the course of their activities in NCI. Other Relevant Parties should contact the IPA Committee to clarify any existing IP arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the avoidance of doubt, NCI, in its sole discretion, may assign to inventor(s), by written instrument only, any IP owned by NCI, which NCI has determined not to be of commercial interest to it. Further, it is understood if NCI does not find a means of exploiting such IP within a three (3) year period after filing, then NCI has the right, but not the obligation, to assign ownership rights to the inventor(s). Requests for assignment to the inventor should be made to the Director of Research.
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to enable the achievement of the aims and goals of this IP Policy, the IPA Committee will, through dissemination of information and the holding of general information sessions for personnel, foster the general awareness of personnel of this policy. In addition, the IPA Committee will provide specific training on this IP Policy and its day to day application and relevance to research active personnel.

         </li>
         <li>
          Whilst the criteria listed above are not exhaustive, it provides guidance to persons submitting an application as well as to those determining the commercial value. As it is a complex decision, the IPA Committee may refer to other expertise (internal or external) where necessary and further criteria may be applied.
         </li>
         <li>
          A decision will be made by the IPA Committee and the originator of the IP will be notified in writing of the decision made.
         </li>
         <li>
          Should the Committee decide to pursue the project; the staff member will be required to complete an IP Assignment Form (see Appendix 8).
         </li>
         <li>
          The IPA Committee may decide in appropriate circumstances, to offer the opportunity to the originator of the IP to pursue exploitation independently if this is deemed appropriate under agreed written terms. NCI will have no rights to commercial revenue resulting from IP, if it subsequently proves successful, subject to any agreed terms.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Submission of a patent application or an application for other protection:
         </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
         <li>
          NCI shall have the right, but not the obligation, either directly or through an outside agent, to seek patent or other protection of the IP and to undertake efforts to introduce the invention into public use.
         </li>
         <li>
          Where a decision is made by the IPA Committee to proceed with an application for protection of the IP, the process below shall be carried out in a timely manner.
         </li>
         <li>
          Where a decision is made by the IPA Committee to proceed with a patent application, the originator of the IP is required to cooperate in every reasonable way, to execute all necessary documents and to assist the IPA Committee in completing the patent application form. The application should remain confidential until such time as the process is complete. Confidentiality agreements will be used where appropriate.
         </li>
         <li>
          Commercialisation activities should recognise specific terms and conditions in appropriate funding contracts including any Collaborative Research Agreements.
         </li>
         <li>
          The cost of the submission of the application shall be paid by NCI. The originator may be required to assist NCI and/or its advisors with the preparation of a claim for appropriate support for IP protection. Any expenses incurred will be reimbursed to NCI prior to the distribution of any royalty or other income (if any) from the IP.
         </li>
         <li>
          The originator of the IP and NCI shall take all reasonable precautions to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the IP in question. The originator of the IP should be aware that publication prior to the filing of patent applications may prevent the granting of certain patents.
         </li>
         <li>
          NCI may decide at any stage to withdraw from the process of exploiting a particular piece of IP. This may arise where:
          <ul>
           <li>
            Concern exists regarding the technical or commercial feasibility of a particular piece of IP,
           </li>
           <li>
            Costs of exploiting the IP are excessive, or
           </li>
           <li>
            External sponsorship of the process is no longer available.
           </li>
          </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
          The originator of the IP will be notified in writing of the intention of NCI to withdraw from the process and the withdrawal will apply from immediate effect.
         </li>
         <li>
          Where a decision is not made about the commercialisation of the IP within the determination period or where it is determined that NCI does not wish to commercialise the IP, the IP may, at NCI’s entire discretion, be assigned or licensed to the originator, offering the opportunity to the originator of the IP to pursue exploitation independently.
         </li>
         <li>
          No patent application, assignment, licensing or other agreement may be entered into or will be considered valid with respect to NCI IP except when properly and lawfully executed by NCI.

         Commercialisation
        </h3>
        <p>
         The IPA Committee will assist, provide advice, or procure the provision of outside professional advice in relation to the various options for commercialisation and technology transfer that may be appropriate in order to best meet the aims of this IP Policy, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Licensing the IP to a third party for a fixed sum or a royalty related to future sales.
         </li>
         <li>
          Assigning the IP to a third party for a fixed sum or a royalty related to future sales.
         </li>
         <li>
          Developing the commercial potential of the IP through a campus company.
         </li>
         <li>
          Developing the commercial potential of the IP through a joint venture with a third party.
         </li>
         <li>
          Any other arrangement that may be considered appropriate.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         A separate NCI Campus Company Policy outlines NCI’s position on spin-off companies and the division of income from such enterprises. This NCI Campus Company Policy is under development.
        </p>
        <p>
         In providing this advice and assistance, the IPA Committee will give due consideration to the retention of the right to use and access know-how and research materials for the purpose of continuing and further research as well as options which may provide most benefit to the Irish economy.

         Distribution of Commercialisation Income
        </h3>
        <p>
         The College shall share a proportion of net royalty and other net income generated by the college from the commercialisation of NCI Intellectual Property with the approved creators or authors of the said intellectual property. This sharing of income is subject to the terms of the policy being met by the creator of the NCI Intellectual Property, including the execution of all appropriate documentation to assign to the College all NCI Intellectual Property that may arise from a particular project or research. The aim is to achieve an equitable distribution of the income that arises from the commercialisation of NCI Intellectual Property between the college, the creator of the intellectual property and, where appropriate, a third party sponsor. The procedure for distribution of the actual net income outlined in this clause does not relate in any way to income earned by the college from equity in campus companies.
        </p>
        <p>
         All direct expenses incurred by the college in the protection and commercialisation of NCI Intellectual Property that arises from a particular project or research (including legal and other costs involved in seeking patent protection for an invention and any subsequent investigation, development and promotion) will be recouped first by the college from the initial royalty or other income or lump sum before calculating the amount of income which can be shared with the relevant creators of the intellectual property in question.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subject to the foregoing, the following guidelines (which may be amended from time to time by NCI) will be used in determining the distribution of net income received by NCI from the commercialisation of a particular piece of NCI Intellectual property:-
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          75% of net income actually received by NCI will be paid (subject to deduction as outlined above of applicable taxes and reimbursement of college costs associated with the protection and exploitation of NCI Intellectual Property (“Net Income”)) to the creators of the intellectual property that are classified as NCI personnel by the policy in such proportions as agreed between the relevant NCI personnel.
          <strong>
           <br/>
          </strong>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         If more than one party is involved in the creation of the particular piece of NCI Intellectual Property, the division of payments between the parties will be based on their relative intellectual contributions as outlined in the Invention Disclosure Form. The division of payments will be agreed by the parties concerned and notified to NCI before a patent application is filed by the college. The college shall not distribute the Net Income unless the relevant parties have agreed the proportions between themselves. If the parties cannot agree the proportions then the college will determine the matter and the decision of the college shall be final (see Appendix 4).
        </p>
        <p>
         It is essential that good research records are prepared during the course of each project. In the event of a dispute, the research records will be of prime importance in making an apportionment between the parties concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
         The division of royalty and other income will generally be carried out within a reasonable timeframe upon receipt of such income. The college shall make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure where possible that creators of the intellectual property benefit from any income tax concessions on income from patents which may be available. For the avoidance of doubt none of the creators of the intellectual property shall be entitled to any share in royalty or other income from commercialisation of research unless NCI has received actual income or royalty payments from such commercialisation.

         11.1.36                Non-Financial Rewards
        </h3>
        <p>
         It is recognised that the development of NCI Intellectual Property is dependent on the existence of satisfactory and equitable agreements on the division of income to provide meaningful rewards to creators of NCI Intellectual Property. However, the college may at its discretion provide non-financial rewards for such activities including academic recognition, improvement in the colleges, schools, centres and institutes facilities and funds for research.

         Organisations and Companies Collaborating with NCI on Research Projects
        </h3>
        <p>
         As an educational institute, NCI has an obligation to ensure the maximum public benefit from the exploitation of IP created from both publicly funded research and collaborative co-funded research. This is usually best maximised when IP is commercially exploited.
        </p>
        <p>
         The NCI IPA Committee will conduct a commercial evaluation on the IP created/to be created in a research project and will seek information from the collaborating organisation on how it intends to commercialise the IP, and also determine the IP ownership rights they require from the project. The evaluation to determine the commercial value and IP ownership rights will include an examination of the criteria listed in paragraph 11 of this policy. All such information requested and provided will be treated in strict confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon above assessment, the IPA Committee will decide on the IP ownership rights NCI requires and will agree the sale/assignment/option, licensing (exclusive or non-exclusive), or joint venture agreements or otherwise with the collaborating company to ensure maximum commercial benefits. A legal agreement will be executed between the parties, setting out the rights, entitlements and obligations of each party prior to the commencement of work on the project.
        </p>
        <p>
         When making decisions regarding management and commercialisation of intellectual property arising from research which is wholly or partly funded by third parties, the College will take account of the following guidelines:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (ICSTI) National Code of Practice for Managing Intellectual Property Arising from Publicly Funded Research, published in 2004.

         <a name="_Toc531687970">
         </a>
         Publication of Research Results
        </h4>
        <p>
         It is college policy to encourage staff and students to place the results of their research in the public domain either through publication in Academic journals or presentation at conferences. This is a vital factor for academic recognition. In accordance with long-standing academic tradition, NCI does not and will not assert ownership of copyright in scholarly publications, books or artistic works of its employees unless there is an agreement to the contrary or patent pending. This exception to NCI ownership of intellectual property does not extend to copyright in software or to database rights. NCI will not assign rights to the usage of teaching materials to any third party without the prior agreement of the author/creator.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, it must be recognised that premature publication or disclosure except on a confidential basis may make it impossible to obtain valid patent protection. The library will provide advice and assistance in relation to confidentiality agreements. The placing of a thesis in the college library without ensuring that accessibility is restricted constitutes publication. A typical arrangement for publication of a patentable invention is described in Appendix 7.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to ensure that the intellectual property remains confidential and is not published for a limited period to enable adequate arrangements to be put in place for its protection where this is feasible. Publication that is in violation of the terms of any agreement between the college with the sponsor of the research or other third party must be avoided.

        </h3>
        <p>
         It is the policy of the college that its management, staff, and others acting on its behalf have an obligation to avoid ethical, legal, financial, or other conflicts of interest and to ensure that their activities and interests do not conflict with their obligations to the college or its welfare. NCI requires full disclosure of potential areas of conflict and open discussion at the earliest possible opportunity. NCI will endeavour to alert staff and Other Relevant Parties to recognise where conflicts may occur and to manage and resolve these conflicts in line with its Conflicts Policy, which is currently under development. Any questions in relation to research ethics should be referred to the Technical Transfer Officer.

          NOTE ON OWNERSHIP OF PATENTS UNDER IRISH LAW
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Irish Law comprises Statute Law (legislation) and Common Law (legal principles developed through judicial decisions over time). The ownership of inventions discovered by an Irish employee working for an Irish employer is not specifically set out in any statutory provision but is covered by the Common Law principle that an employer owns the product of his employee’s work where that work was done in the course of the employment unless there is an agreement to the contrary.

          Intellectual Property (IP)
         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         Intellectual property as the tangible or intangible results of research, development, teaching, or other intellectual activity which is manifested in the form of copyrights, patents, trademarks, industrial designs and confidential/proprietary information. Intellectual property allows creativity and innovation to be captured and owned in the same way as physical property can be owned. Intellectual property includes individually and collectively all technical innovations, inventions, improvements, and/or discoveries, information, writings and software, whether or not patentable or otherwise susceptible to intellectual property protection, including technology and materials in their tangible form. This is the general term for intangible property rights which are a result of intellectual effort.

          Patent
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         A patent grants, for a limited period, the right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing the subject matter described by the claims of the patent except with the consent of the patentee. A patent contains a narrative description of the subject matter covered by the patent called the specification. It also contains one or more claims that describe the subject matter covered by the patent in highly technical and specific terms. A patent, as a form of 'industrial property', can be bought and sold, licensed or used by the owner either in whole or in part.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are three basic criteria required to patent an invention. The invention must be novel, have an inventive step (i.e. it should not be obvious to someone skilled in the state-of-the-art) and it should have an industrial application. All three criteria must be met.

          Trade Mark
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         A trade mark is the means by which a business identifies its goods or services and distinguishes them from the goods and services supplied by other businesses. The Trade Marks Act, 1996 defines a trade mark as "any sign capable of being represented graphically which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings."
        </p>
        <p>
         A trade mark may consist of words, (including personal names), designs, logos, letters, numerals or the shape of goods or of their packaging, or of other signs or indications that are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of others.

          Design
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         A design means the appearance of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, the lines, contours, colour, shape, texture or materials of the product itself or its ornamentation. A registered design is a form of 'industrial property', which can be assigned, transferred, licensed or used by the owner. Design protection is territorial; in effect a design registered in Ireland is only valid in Ireland. Some aspects of the "design" may also be protected by copyright.

          Copyright

        </p>
        <p>
         Copyright is the legal term, which describes the rights given to authors/creators of certain categories of work. Copyright protection extends to the following works:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works;
         </li>
         <li>
          sound recordings, films;
         </li>
         <li>
          broadcasts, cable programmes;
         </li>
         <li>
          the typographical arrangement of published editions;
         </li>
         <li>
          computer programmes;
         </li>
         <li>
          Original databases.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The owner of copyright is the author, meaning the person who creates the work. However, as copyright is a form of property, the right may be transferred to someone else, for example, to a publisher. Copyright is a property right and the owner of the work can control the use of the work, subject to certain exceptions. The owner has the exclusive right to prohibit or authorise others to undertake the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          copy the work;
         </li>
         <li>
          perform the work;
         </li>
         <li>
          make the work available to the public through broadcasting or recordings;
         </li>
         <li>
          Make an adaptation of the work.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Copyright takes effect as soon as the work is put on paper, film, or other fixed medium such as CD-ROM, DVD, Internet, etc. No protection is provided for ideas while the ideas are in a persons mind; copyright law protects the form of expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves.

        <p>
         Protection for confidential information and know-how arises from the law of confidentiality. The confidential information may be know-how associated with a Patent or a Patent Application, or material in existence before, for example, a Patent Application is filed, or material already protected by another form of intellectual property, for example, copyright.

         The IP Policy is applicable to

          NCI Intellectual Property
         </em>
         that is owned by NCI for any of the reasons outlined below:
        </p>
        <p>
         It is developed by NCI Personnel in the course of their normal or specifically assigned duties either when intellectual property could be reasonably expected to result from the carrying out of those duties and/or, at the time the intellectual property was developed, there was a special obligation on the relevant NCI Personnel to further the interest of NCI.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the 2000 Act (as defined below), NCI is the first owner of any copyright in the work created by NCI Personnel in the course of his/her employment unless precluded by a prior agreement between NCI and a third party (or is covered by section 11.1.29 of this IP Policy ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The intellectual property arises out of funded or non-funded research where such research has, in the opinion of NCI, made use of the equipment, facilities, NCI Assets and other resources of NCI unless such action was precluded by prior agreement between NCI and third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
         If it is a condition of a research contract with a third party that NCI should have ownership of the intellectual property arising from the contract.

         I understand that, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, National College of Ireland (NCI) is governed in the handling of intellectual property by its official policy titled Intellectual Property Policy and Procedures, (a copy of which I have read), and I agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this policy in the course of my NCI activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a general rule (and subject to the exceptions set out in this policy) any intellectual property rights in any material, (including any copyright (including rights in computer software and moral rights), patent, design right, trademark rights, brand rights, database rights, know how, trade secrets, confidential information rights in design, or other intellectual property rights or other property rights, whether vested, contingent or future anywhere in the world), created by me in the course of my work or study with NCI is the property of and vests solely and absolutely in NCI (“NCI Intellectual Property”).
        </p>
        <p>
         Pursuant to this policy, and in consideration of my participation in projects administered by NCI, access to or use of facilities provided by NCI and/or other consideration, I hereby agree as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          I will disclose to NCI all potentially patentable inventions and other NCI Intellectual Property conceived or first reduced to practice in whole or in part in the course of my NCI responsibilities, my participation in research projects at NCI or with use of college resources. I further assign [jointly] to NCI [and to my non-NCI employer] all my right, title and interest in such patentable inventions and other NCI Intellectual Property created in connection with NCI and to execute and deliver all documents and do any and all such things necessary and proper on my part to effect such assignment. Such assignment is not inconsistent with the terms of my continuing employment outside of NCI or with any other agreement I have entered into.
         </li>
         <li>
          I will not use any information defined as confidential or proprietary by my non-NCI employer in the course of my NCI responsibilities and I will not do consulting or research work for my non-NCI employer while at any facility owned or leased by NCI.
         </li>
         <li>
          I am free to place my inventions in the public domain as long as in so doing neither I nor NCI violates the terms of any agreements that governed the work done or my agreements with my non-NCI employer.
         </li>
         <li>
          I will not enter into any agreement creating copyright or patent obligations in conflict with this agreement.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         This agreement is effective on date of my NCI hire, enrolment or participation in projects administered by NCI, and is binding on me, my estate, heirs and assigns.

          Any person to whom a reference is made under Clause 2.I shall act as an arbitrator (“the Arbitrator”) and shall be entitled to appoint such technical expert or experts as he considers necessary to assist him in determining the matter referred to him. The decision of the Arbitrator (which shall be given by him in writing stating his reasons therefore) shall be final and binding on the parties. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Acts 1954-1998.

         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Every effort shall be made to ensure that intellectual property protection causes a minimum delay to the publication of related research. Where possible the delay in publication to enable a patent application to be filed should be for an agreed limited period, typically less than 60 days. In the case of research funded by third parties a typical arrangement is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          The third party would be informed at least 30 days before submission of a publication
         </li>
         <li>
          The third party would be given 30 days to decide whether publication should be delayed
         </li>
         <li>
          Upon the request of the third party the submission for publication may be delayed for up to a further 30 days to enable the parties to secure adequate protection of the IPR that would be affected by publication.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         In the event that the protection of IPR is not feasible and where publication may jeopardize commercialisation, the submission for publication may be delayed for up to an additional period to enable an approach to commercialisation to be agreed.

         , (a copy of which I have received), and I agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this IP Policy in the course of my NCI activities and in the work that I carry out on the Project.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         As a general rule (and subject to the exceptions set out in this IP Policy) any intellectual property rights in any material, (including any copyright (including rights in computer software and moral rights), patent, design right, trademark rights, brand rights, database rights, know how, trade secrets, confidential information rights in design or other intellectual property rights or other property rights, whether vested, contingent or future anywhere in the world), created by me in the course of my work with NCI (and in particular in the course of my work on the Project) are the property of and vest solely and absolutely in NCI (“NCI IP”).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Pursuant to the IP Policy, and in consideration of my participation in projects (and the Project(s)) administered by NCI, access to or use of facilities provided by NCI and/or other consideration, I hereby agree as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         I will disclose to NCI all potentially patentable inventions and other NCI IP conceived or first reduced to practice in whole or in part in the course of my NCI responsibilities, my participation in the Project(s) at NCI or with more than incidental use of NCI resources. I further assign to NCI all my right, title and interest in such patentable inventions and other NCI IP created in connection with NCI and/or the Project(s) and to execute and deliver all documents and do any and all such things necessary and proper on my part to effect such assignment. Such assignment is not inconsistent with the terms of my continuing employment outside of NCI (if any) or with any other agreement I have entered into.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         I will not use any information defined as confidential or proprietary by any non-NCI employer (if any) in the course of my NCI responsibilities and I will not do consulting or research work for any non-NCI employer (unless such work is approved of in writing in advance by NCI).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         I will not enter into any agreement creating copyright or patent obligations in conflict with this Agreement. I hereby waive any moral rights to which I may be entitled under any legislation now existing or in future enacted in any part of the world and for the avoidance of doubt this waiver shall extend to the licensees and successors in title to the copyright in the NCI IP and the Project(s).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         This Agreement is effective on date of my NCI hire, enrolment or participation in projects administered by NCI, and is binding on me, my estate, heirs and assigns.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         [I hereby agree and acknowledge that in respect of the Project and in respect of my assignment of IP to NCI in this Agreement, my full and final entitlement to payment, royalty or other income arising therefrom is set out in the Schedule to this Agreement and I further agree and acknowledge that I shall have no other entitlement or claim against NCI or any party to whom NCI assigns or licences this IP in respect of payment, royalty or other income arising therefrom.

        <p>
         For the purposes of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, I hereby consent to the processing of all personal data that I provide to NCI in connection with the performance of the Services and the Agreement.

        <p>
         Gallen Alliance solicitors recommended that NCI Board be in agreement with some ‘Principles in IP policy’ before recirculating policy document to Research committee.  They have suggested NCI Board agree following Principles.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           Principle- IP Management Strategy:
          </em>
         </strong>
         It is intended that the written NCI IPP explains how IP management supports and relates to the overall mission of NCI, and how the IPP will benefit the NCI (see Introduction and Aims of Policy).The IPP should include a confirmation that the NCI Board is in full agreement with these introductory Principles (for example, the IPP Principles, as approved by the NCI Board, might be placed at the commencement of the detailed Policy and used as a shortened version for NCI to include, for example, on its Internet and Intranet websites).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           Principle- Technology Transfer Office and IP Advisory Committee:
          </em>
         </strong>
         It is intended that a Technology Transfer Office and an Intellectual Property Advisory Committee will be established and the roles and responsibilities are outlined in the IPP (
         <em>
          see Section 6 Support Programme of Policy).
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           Principle – Disclosure and Evaluation of new IP:
          </em>
         </strong>
         It is intended that a formal invention disclosure process will be set up. (
         <em>
          see Section 12 Disclosure and Evaluation
         </em>
         )  In certain circumstances NCI may decide not to pursue commercialisation and it may instead decide to offer the opportunity to the inventor to pursue exploitation independently (under appropriate terms).
        </p>

         <span>
          It is intended that Technology Transfer activities should be pursued in a timely manner through partnership between the TTO and the relevant inventors/researchers and with the industrial/commercial partner as appropriate. Various options for commercialisation will be considered

         </strong>
         It is intended that the IP Policy will clearly state that the ownership of IP generated by staff and students will be vested in NCI (
         <em>
          Section on General Provisions of NCI Policy
         </em>
         ).  Having regard to the legal position regarding ownership, the IP policy will be supported by appropriate written agreements, which are acknowledged and agreed by all individuals involved in research.  Institute ownership of arising IP is a requirement of all state funding agencies in Ireland where projects are 100% publicly funded.   In accordance with long-standing academic tradition, NCI does not and will not assert ownership of copyright in scholarly publications, books or artistic works of its employees unless there is an agreement to the contrary or patent pending (Publication of Research Results Section).
         <em>
          This exception to NCI ownership of intellectual property does not extend to copyright in software or to database rights. NCI will not assign rights to the usage of teaching materials to any third party without the prior agreement of the author/creator.

         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         that they will share in general revenue generated by company. E.g. If company made 100,000 and royalty payable was 10,000 (NCI and inventor would share income 10,000 not 100,000), the other 90,000 would remain within the company.  Inventors may own the company.
